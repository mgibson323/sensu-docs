## 6.1.0 release notes

**October 5, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.1.0, is now available for download.

This release delivers significant performance and stability gains, feature enhancements, and several bug fixes. The web UI is now much snappier, and its search is redesigned with an improved syntax and suggestions! Monitor even more services and infrastructure when using the PostgreSQL store: batched Sensu event writes and improved indexing allows a single Sensu Go deployment to process and query more data than ever before. If you’re using Prometheus client libraries to instrument your applications, the Sensu Go agent can now scrape and enrich those metrics! And if you’re collecting metrics in other formats like Nagios PerfData, you can use the new output metric tags feature to enrich those metrics too! The sensuctl prune command also received some love, and it now loads and prunes configuration resources from multiple files!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.1.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

## 6.0.0 release notes

**August 10, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 6.0.0, is now available for download.

With Sensu Go 6.0.0, you can control everything through the API. You can still use configuration management tools to bootstrap agent entities, but you don’t need to! Our new agent entity management feature via the backend configuration API nearly eliminates the need for external (or out-of-band) configuration management for Sensu, which allows you to manage agent entity subscriptions and automate the discovery of system facts without updating agent local configuration files. Run a sensuctl command, click a button in the web UI, or execute a custom check plugin!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 6.0.0.

**BREAKING CHANGES FOR SENSU 6.0:**

- The database schema for entities has changed.
As a result, after you complete the steps to [upgrade to Sensu 6.0][170] (including running the `sensu-backend upgrade` command), you will not be able to use your database with older versions of Sensu.
- For Sensu Go instances [built from source][164], the web UI is now a [standalone product][163] &mdash; it is no longer included with the Sensu backend.
Visit the [Sensu Go Web repository][163] for more information.
- After initial creation, you cannot change your [`sensu-agent` entity configuration][171] by modifying the agent's configuration file.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][162]) Sensu now logs a warning when secrets cannot be sent to an agent because mTLS is not enabled.
- ([Commercial feature][162]) Added [JavaScript functions][169] `sensu.EventStatus`, `sensu.FetchEvent`, and `sensu.ListEvents` to the filter execution environment so you can now query the Sensu event store for other events within the filter namespace.
- ([Commercial feature][162]) Docker-only Sensu now binds to the hostname of containers instead of `localhost`. Docker images now set their own default values for environment variables `SENSU_AGENT_API_URL`, `SENSU_BACKEND_API_URL`, `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_INITIAL_CLUSTER`, `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_ADVERTISE_CLUSTER`, `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_INITIAL_ADVERTISE_PEER_URLS`, `SENSU_BACKEND_ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS`, and `ETCD_LISTEN_PEER_URLS`.
- ([Commercial feature][162]) Added Linux packages for 386; armv5, armv6, and armv7; MIPS hard float, MIPS LE hard float, and MIPS 64 LE hard float; ppc64le; and s390x architectures.

- Agent entity updates now ignore state-related fields.
- You can now manage Sensu agent configuration via the HTTP API.
- For sysvinit services, Sensu now passes users' secondary groups (that is, groups other than the Sensu user group) to `chroot`, which gives the Sensu agent and backend access to the file access writes that are granted to the secondary groups.
- Output of `sensuctl asset add` now includes help for using the runtime asset.
- For role bindings and cluster role bindings, [`subjects.name`][166] values can now include unicode characters, and [`roleRef.type`][167] and [`subjects.type`][166] values are now automatically capitalized.

- Sensu now logs and returns and error if it cannot find a mutator.
- Errors produced in the agent by assets, check validation, token substitution, and event unmarshaling are logged once again.
- The User-Agent header is now set only upon on new client creation rather than upon each request.
- When the Sensu agent cannot parse the proper CA certificate path, Sensu logs this in the error message.
- Fixed a bug where highly concurrent event filtering could result in a panic.
- Fixed a bug where nil labels or annotations in an event filtering context would require you to explicitly check whether the annotations or labels are undefined.
With this fix, labels and annotations are always defined (although they may be empty).
- Fixed the log entry field for the check's name in schedulerd.

## 5.21.0 release notes

**June 15, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.21.0, is now available for download.

The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.21.0, is now available for download! This release delivers several enhancements and fixes. The most significant enhancements involve user management: you can now generate a password hash, specify the resulting hash in your user definitions without having to store cleartext passwords, and create and update these users using `sensuctl create`. You can also reset user passwords via the backend API. We also tuned Sensu Go agent logging and changed the default log level from warning to info. Plus, we crushed a number of nasty bugs: checks configured with missing hooks can no longer crash the agent, proxy check request errors do not block scheduling for other entities, and more!

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.21.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][158]) Added [entity count and limit][156] for each entity class in the tabular title in the response for `sensuctl license info` (in addition to the total entity count and limit).

- Added the ability to reset passwords via the backend API and `sensuctl user reset-password`.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- Changed the [default log level for `sensu-agent`][157] to `info` (instead of `warn`).

**FIXES:**

- The password verification logic when running `sensuctl user change-password` is now included in the backend API rather than sensuctl.
- Errors in publishing proxy check requests no longer block scheduling for other entities.
- Using the `--chunk-size` flag when listing namespaces in sensuctl now works properly.
- The agent no longer immediately exits in certain scenarios when components are disabled.
- Fixed a bug that could cause a GraphQL query to fail when querying a namespace that contained event data in excess of 2 GB.

## 5.20.2 release notes

**May 26, 2020** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.20.2, is now available for download.

This patch release adds username to the API request log to help operators with troubleshooting and user activity reporting, as well as validation for subjects in role-based access control (RBAC) role binding and cluster role binding.
Release 5.20.2 also temporarily disables process discovery so we can investigate and resolve its performance impact on the backend (increased CPU and memory usage).

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.20.2.

This release is packed with new features, improvements, and fixes, including our first alpha feature: declarative configuration pruning to help keep your Sensu instance in sync with Infrastructure as Code workflows.
Other exciting additions include the ability to save and share your filtered searches in the web UI, plus a new `matches` substring match operator that you can use to refine your filtering results!
Improvements include a new `created_by` field in resource metadata and a `float_type` field that stores whether your system uses hard float or soft float.
We've also added agent and sensuctl builds for MIPS architectures, moved Bonsai logs to the `debug` level, and added PostgreSQL health information to the health API payload.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.19.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][122]) In the [web UI][124], you can now [save, recall, and delete filtered searches][123].

This is a significant release, with new features, improvements, and fixes!
We’re ecstatic to announce the release of secrets management, which eliminates the need to expose sensitive information in your Sensu configuration.
When a Sensu component such as a check or handler requires a secret (like a username or password), Sensu will be able to fetch that information from one or more external secrets providers (for example, HashiCorp Vault) and provide it to the Sensu component via temporary environment variables.
Secrets management allows you to move secrets out of your Sensu configuration, giving you the ability to safely and confidently share your Sensu configurations with your fellow Sensu users!
This release also includes per-entity keepalive event handler configuration, a sought-after feature for users who have migrated from Sensu 1.x to Sensu Go.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.17.0.

**NEW FEATURES:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Added [HTTP API for secrets management][108], with a built-in `Env` secrets provider and support for HashiCorp Vault secrets management. The secrets provider resource is implemented for checks, mutators, and handlers.
- Added the `keepalive-handlers` agent configuration flag to specify the keepalive handlers to use for an entity's events.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][106]) Upgraded the size of the events auto-incremented ID in the PostgreSQL store to a 64-bit variant, which allows you to store many more events and avoids exhausting the sequence.

- In the [web UI][107], fixed a bug that duplicated event history in the event timeline chart.
- `sensuctl command` assets installed via Bonsai now use the `sensuctl` namespace.
- Fixed a bug where failing check TTL events could occur if keepalive failures had already occurred.

## 5.16.1 release notes

**December 18, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.1, is now available for download.
This release fixes a performance regression that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased and includes a change to display the `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter by default.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.1.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- The `sensu_go_events_processed` Prometheus counter now initializes with the `success` label so the count is always displayed.

**FIXES:**

- The performance regression introduced in 5.15.0 that caused API latency to scale linearly as the number of connected agents increased is fixed.

## 5.16.0 release notes

**December 16, 2019** &mdash; The latest release of Sensu Go, version 5.16.0, is now available for download.
This is another important release, with many new features, improvements, and fixes.
We introduced an initialization subcommand for **new** installations that allows you to specify an admin username and password instead of using a pre-defined default.
We also added new backend flags to help you take advantage of etcd auto-discovery features and agent flags you can use to define a timeout period for critical and warning keepalive events.

New web UI features include a switcher that makes it easier to switch between namespaces in the dashboard, breadcrumbs on every page, OIDC authentication in the dashboard, a drawer that replaces the app bar to make more room for content, and more.

We also fixed issues with `sensuctl dump` and `sensuctl cluster health`, installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai, and missing namespaces in keepalive events and events created through the agent socket interface.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.16.0.

**IMPORTANT:**

- For Ubuntu/Debian and RHEL/CentOS installations, the backend is no longer seeded with a default admin username and password.

- Added the ['sensu-backend init' subcommand][102].
- Added the [`--etcd-discovery`][100] and [`--etcd-discovery-srv`][100] flags to sensu-backend, which allow users to take advantage of the embedded etcd's auto-discovery features.
- Added [`--keepalive-critical-timeout`][101] to define the time after which a critical keepalive event should be created for an agent and [`--keepalive-warning-timeout`][101], which is an alias of `--keepalive-timeout` for backward compatibility.

**IMPROVEMENTS:**

- ([Commercial feature][105]) The entity limit warning message is now displayed less aggressively and the warning threshold is proportional to the entity limit.
- A new switcher in the [web UI][103] makes it easier to switch namespaces in the dashboard.
Access the new component from the drawer or with the shortcut ctrl+k.
For users who have many namespaces, the switcher now includes fuzzy search and improved keyboard navigation.
- In the [web UI][103], replaced the app bar with an omnipresent drawer to increase the available space for content. Each page also now includes breadcrumbs.
- In the [Sensu documentation][104], links now point to the version of the product being run instead of the latest, which may be helpful when running an older version of Sensu.

**FIXES:**

- `sensuctl dump` help now shows the correct default value for the format flag.
- Installing sensuctl commands via Bonsai will now check for correct labels before checking if the asset has 1 or more builds.

## 5.0.1 release notes

**December 12, 2018** &mdash; Sensu Go 5.0.1 includes our top bug fixes following last week's general availability release.

Read the [upgrade guide][1] to upgrade Sensu to version 5.0.1.

**FIXED:**

- The Sensu backend can now successfully connect to an external etcd cluster.
- The Sensu dashboard now sorts silences in ascending order, correctly displays status values, and reduces shuffling in the event list.
- Sensu agents on Windows now execute command arguments correctly.
- Sensu agents now correctly include environment variables when executing checks.
- Command arguments are no longer escaped on Windows.
- Sensu backend environments now include handler and mutator execution requests.
